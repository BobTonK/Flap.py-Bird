# Flap.py
A simple recreation of the classic mobile game in pygame

All sprites and audio were borrowed from https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird.

In order to run, Pygame, numpy, and PIL must be installed.

Instructions: Simply run the python file. Once the game window opens, press SPACE to jump, press RETURN or SPACE to start over after you (inevitably) die.

To come: a menu when the game starts, a high score counter, and an "auto-pilot" mode.
